Add this to app.py:

1. Import the db_routes Blueprint:
```python
from routes.db_routes import db_routes
```

2. Register the Blueprint:
```python
app.register_blueprint(db_routes)
```

Make sure to place these after the other imports and registrations in app.py.

Additionally, make sure your app.py has the following function which is used by db_routes.py:

```python
# Helper function to log message to deployment log
def log_message(deployment_id, message):
    """Log a message to the deployment logs and the application log"""
    if deployment_id in deployments:
        # Add to deployment logs
        if "logs" not in deployments[deployment_id]:
            deployments[deployment_id]["logs"] = []
        deployments[deployment_id]["logs"].append(message)
        
        # Also log to application log
        logger.debug(f"[{deployment_id}] {message}")
```

This function should already exist in your app.py file. If not, add it too.
